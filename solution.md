
The error message "Failed to execute 'replaceState' on 'History': #
 could not be clone" suggests that you are trying to pass an object that cannot be cloned in the replaceState method of the History API in Vue.js.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that you are passing a serializable object to the replaceState method. Make sure that the object you are trying to pass does not contain any non-serializable data types such as functions, circular references, or DOM elements.


If you need to store complex data in the History API, consider serializing the object using JSON.stringify before passing it to replaceState. Then, when retrieving the object, use JSON.parse to deserialize it.


Here's an example of serializing and deserializing an object:

``` javascript
Copy code
const state = {
  data: 'some data',
  // ... other properties
};

// Serializing the object before passing it to replaceState
const serializedState = JSON.stringify(state);
history.replaceState({ state: serializedState }, 'Title', '/url');

// Deserializing the object when retrieving it
const deserializedState = JSON.parse(history.state.state);
```

By ensuring that you pass a serializable object to the replaceState method, you should be able to resolve the error.
